--  == Part streams ==
--  The `Input_Part_Stream` is an input stream which decomposes an input stream
--  in several parts separated by well known and fixed boundaries.  It can be used
--  to read multipart streams, certificate files, private and public keys and others.
--  The example below shows how to read a file composed of several parts separated
--  by well defined text boundaries.
--
--    with Util.Streams.Files;
--    with Util.Streams.Buffered.Parts;
--    ...
--      In_Stream   : aliased Util.Streams.Files.File_Stream;
--      Part_Stream : Util.Streams.Buffered.Parts.Input_Part_Stream;
--
--  With the above declarations, the `Input_Part_Stream` is configured to read from
--  the `File_Stream` by using the `Initialize` procedure and giving a buffer size.
--  The buffer size must be large enough to hold the largest fixed boundary plus some
--  extra.
--
--    Part_Stream.Initialize (Input => In_Stream'Unchecked_Access, Size => 4096);
--
--  Once it is configured, the first boundary to stop at is configured by using
--  the `Set_Boundary` procedure.  The example below is intended to extract the
--  certificate from a PEM file.  The certificate (encoded in Base64) is enclosed in
--  two different markers.  The first boundary is first defined as follows:
--
--    Part_Stream.Set_Boundary ("-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" & ASCII.LF);
--
--  After calling `Set_Boundary`, we can start reading the `Part_Stream` and it will
--  stop when the boundary string is found.  If we want to drop content until the
--  first boundary is found, we can loop until the boundary is found.  To extract the
--  certificate content, we want to skip everything until the first boundary is found
--  in the stream:
--
--    while not Part_Stream.Is_Eob loop
--      Part_Stream.Read (Item);
--    end loop;
--
--  Once a boundary is reached, trying to read from the stream will raise the standard
--  `Data_Error` exception.  We can either use `Next_Part` to prepare and read for a
--  next part with the same boundary or call `Set_Boundary` with another boundary.
--  To extract the certificate content, we can do:
--
--    Part_Stream.Set_Boundary ("-----END CERTIFICATE-----" & ASCII.LF);
--    Part_Stream.Read (Content);
