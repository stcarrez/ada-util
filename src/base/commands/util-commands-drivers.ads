--  == Command line driver ==
--  The `Util.Commands.Drivers` generic package provides a support to build command line
--  tools that have different commands identified by a name.  It defines the `Driver_Type`
--  tagged record that provides a registry of application commands.  It gives entry points
--  to register commands and execute them.
--
--  The `Context_Type` package parameter defines the type for the `Context` parameter
--  that is passed to the command when it is executed.  It can be used to provide
--  application specific context to the command.
--
--  The `Config_Parser` describes the parser package that will handle the analysis of
--  command line options.  To use the GNAT options parser, it is possible to use the
--  `Util.Commands.Parsers.GNAT_Parser` package.
--
--  The `IO` package parameter allows to control the operations that the command line
--  support will use to print some message on the console.  When strings are encoded
--  in Latin-1, it is possible to give the `Util.Commands.Text_IO` package that will
--  use the standard `Ada.Text_IO` package to write on the console.  When strings are
--  encoded in UTF-8, it is best to use the `Util.Commands.Raw_IO` package that will
--  write the strings unmodified on the console.
