--  == Executors ==
--  The `Util.Executors` generic package defines a queue of work that will be executed
--  by one or several tasks.  The `Work_Type` describes the type of the work and the
--  `Execute` procedure will be called by the task to execute the work.  After instantiation
--  of the package, an instance of the `Executor_Manager` is created with a number of desired
--  tasks.  The tasks are then started by calling the `Start` procedure.
--
--  A work object is added to the executor's queue by using the `Execute` procedure.
--  The work object is added in a concurrent fifo queue.  One of the task managed by the
--  executor manager will pick the work object and run it.
