--  This project defines a small executable used by the process execution unit test.
--  It is now as a separate project because the arm-linux-gnueabi compiler fails
--  to link due to the AWS shared library that needs the GNARL runtime.  For some
--  reasons, the -lgnarl-4.6 is not passed on that platform.
--  By using a specific and simpler project, we avoid dependencies to other Ada libraries
--  which are in fact not used by this tool.
