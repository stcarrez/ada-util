Ada Utility Library

This Ada05 library contains various utility packages for building
Ada05 applications.  This includes:

 o A logging framework close to Java log4j framework,
 o Support for properties
 o A serialization/deserialization framework for XML, JSON, CSV
 o Ada beans framework
 o Encoding/decoding framework (Base16, Base64, SHA, HMAC-SHA)
 o A composing stream framework (raw, files, buffers, pipes, sockets)
 o Several concurrency tools (reference counters, counters, pools, fifos, arrays)
 o Process creation and pipes
 o Support for loading shared libraries (on Windows or Unix)
 o HTTP client library on top of CURL or AWS

Ada Util also provides a small test utility library on top of
Ahven or AUnit to help in writing unit tests.
To use Ahven testing framework, configure as follows:

   ./configure --enable-ahven
   make

To use AUnit, build with the following commands:

   ./configure
   make


The samples can be built using:

   gnatmake -Psamples
   
   
The unit tests are built and executed with:

   make test

Or manually build with:

   gnatmake -Ptests


And unit tests are executed with (166 success, 0 failed):

   bin/util_harness

For the installation, use the following command:

   make install
